# openMINDS-metadata-creator
A Jupyter notebook for creating openMINDS JSON-LD metadata collections for TVB-ready data.

CAUTION: This is not the official repository of the openMINDS schema specification. The code in this repository was used to generate openMINDS metadata for curation of TVB-on-EBRAINS datasets. For the current standard please refer to the repository of the openMINDS schema specification:

https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS

# What can I find here?
* a Jupyter Python notebook with code and commentaries for creating openMINDS metadata in JSON-LD format
* openMINDS metadata can be directly ingested by EBRAINS' KnowledgeGraph
* it allows to annotate neuroscientific data (e.g. MRI) with metadata that specifies properties of the data in a structured manner and that allows better finding and reuse of the data.
* For more information, please visit the main openMINDS repository: https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS

Note: openMINDS is under ongoing development. The provided notebook was successfully used to create valid metadata sets, however, this may change if the standard changes.

# Further information
openMINDS metadata is required for curation of a data set for publication in EBRAINS' KnowledgeGraph
